The issue lies in the Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`).  The `content` array within the configuration isn't correctly pointing to the files containing your HTML or templates where you are using Tailwind classes. This prevents Tailwind from parsing and processing the classes, leading to unexpected styling behavior or missing styles entirely.
