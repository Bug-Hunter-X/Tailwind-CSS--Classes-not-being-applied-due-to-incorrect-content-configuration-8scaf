# Tailwind CSS Configuration Issue: Missing Styles

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when setting up Tailwind CSS: classes not being applied due to a misconfiguration in the `tailwind.config.js` file.  The problem arises when the `content` array within the configuration does not correctly specify the locations of your HTML or template files where Tailwind classes are being used.  This leads to Tailwind failing to process the classes and consequently, styles are not applied.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Observe that the styles defined in the CSS are not applied in the HTML.
3. Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for the corrected configuration.

## Solution

The solution involves correcting the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` to correctly point to the relevant files containing the Tailwind classes. Ensure that the paths specified are accurate and complete.
